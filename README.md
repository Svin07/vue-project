When you click on the photo of the product, a page with a detailed description of the product opens.
On the main page, an autoslider displays advertising information about products or promotions.

The shopping cart displays the total amount of the order and the tax percentage (for example).
The site is connected to the educational backend https://mockapi.io/, therefore, unfortunately, not all functions work adequately.
